# About

Hello! My name is gravitowl, and I like to do stupid stuff. I got this idea from megat69/Assassin_craft on discord. He was making his own language using Python, you can go to this repo [here.](https://github.com/megat69/ACPL)

This project is just basically me, trying to do something cool. It's completely for fun and has no other purpose. If you want to use it for anything, you are free to use it. If you do show it off to any people, please credit me. This won't be any advanced thing, just the basics as it's also a way of me learning some more JS and Node.

## Print

The print function can be used to log text to the console. The print function is used like this: print(text);. There is no need for "" around the text, and variables can be inputed in the text with using {variable name} inside of the ( ).

#### Examples:

* We want to print "Hello World!" to the console:
Input: print(Hello World!); Output: Hello World!
* We want to print the variable X, that has been pre-set to a value of 10:
Input: print({X}); Output: 10.
* We want to print the variable X, that has been pre-set to a value of 10 with the text "X is: " in front of it:
Input: print(X is: {X}); Output: X is 10.

## Variables

Variables can be used to print custom values, and to give more interaction with the user. Variables are used like this: var (variable name) = (value). The value can be anything, from strings to integers. You don't need "" to specify strings, booleans can be used and integers too.

### Examples:

* We want to set a variable named X to 10:
Input: var x = 10;
