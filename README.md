# About

Hello! My name is gravitowl, and I like to do stupid stuff. I got this idea from megat69/Assassin_craft on discord. He was making his own language using Python, you can go to this repo [here.](https://github.com/megat69/ACPL)

This project is just basically me, trying to do something cool. It's completely for fun and has no other purpose. If you want to use it for anything, you are free to use it. If you do show it off to any people, please credit me. This won't be any advanced thing, just the basics as it's also a way of me learning some more JS and Node.

# Important Notes

All lines should end with a ;. Otherwhise this won't work. Currently, only single line commands are supported.

## Print

The print function can be used to log text to the console. The print function is used like this: print(text);. There is no need for "" around the text, and variables can be inputed in the text with using {variable name} inside of the ( ).

#### Examples:

* We want to print "Hello World!" to the console:
Input: print(Hello World!); Output: Hello World!
